Automated Email System

This project demonstrates how to send automated emails using Django and Celery, with email addresses read from a CSV file.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Django 3.x or later
	•	Celery
	•	Redis (for task queueing)
	•	SMTP service (for sending emails)

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-emails.git
    cd automated-emails

Set up a virtual environment:
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate

Install required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt


Set up Redis:
	•	Redis is required for task scheduling via Celery.
	•	Make sure Redis is installed and running:
        redis-server


Celery Configuration
    In your settings.py, configure the Celery message broker and task result backend:
        # settings.py

        CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
        CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json']
        CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
        CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
        CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'UTC'

Celery Beat Schedule
    Define your periodic tasks in the settings.py under CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE. For example, to schedule an email to be sent daily at 10:01 AM:
        from celery.schedules import crontab

        CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
            'send-email-daily': {
                'task': 'automated_email.tasks.send_automated_email',
                'schedule': crontab(hour=10, minute=1),
            },
        }

Celery Task Definition

    In the tasks.py file, define the task to be scheduled:
        # automated_email/tasks.py
        from celery import shared_task

        @shared_task
        def send_automated_email():
            # Logic for sending automated email
            print("Sending automated email...")

Celery Worker and Beat

    Start the Celery worker and Celery beat to handle the periodic tasks.

    Start Celery Worker:
        celery -A automated_email worker --loglevel=debug
    Start Celery Beat:
    celery -A automated_email beat --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler --loglevel=debug

Run the Django development server:
    python manage.py runserver


Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are some common solutions:
	•	Make sure Redis is running.
	•	Ensure Celery is properly configured and the tasks are registered.
	•	Double-check your task schedules in the Celery beat configuration.
	•	Restart the Celery worker and beat if necessary.
